# CR-10-Mini-HELP-
Commpletely lost and probably taken on more than I can handle.
Updated a old CR-10 Mini with new Micro Swiss NG direct dirve head, BTT SRK mini E3 v 3.0 and BTT TFT 3.0 touch screen and BLTouch
I have no idea hot to set up the Marlin firmware for this combination of part to work.
Would be great if someone can provide a firmware that I can load.
AT 74, should stick with watching TV!
Thanks to anyone that can help.  This is like putting a not in a bottle and casting it into the ocean!
