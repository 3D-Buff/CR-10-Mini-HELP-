# CR-10-Mini-HELP-
Completely lost and probably taken on more than I can handle.
Updated an old CR-10 Mini with a new Micro Swiss NG direct-drive head, BTT SRK mini E3 v 3.0 and BTT TFT 3.0 touch screen and BIQU Micro Probe
I have no idea how to set up the Marlin firmware for this combination of parts to work.
Would be great if someone could provide a firmware that I can load.
AT 74, should stick with watching TV!
Thanks to anyone who can help.  This is like putting a note in a bottle and casting it into the ocean!
